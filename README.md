# Dove Protocol • ![solidity](https://img.shields.io/badge/solidity-^0.8.15-lightgrey)

Provide liquidity on L1, trade on L2.

Minimized risks, maximized security.

## What is Dove?

Dove is our take on the decentralized AMM dAMM idea that was formulated by Brecht Devos and Louis Guthmann. You can find their original post [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/damm-an-l2-powered-amm/10352).

The liquidity and pricing logics are separated. Liquidity is on L1, trading happens on L2s.

It also means that for any given pair, multiple AMMs on different layers will share the same liquidity, it’s **amplified**. It exposes the LPs to potentially much more trades, thus more fees. It’s a more efficient use of liquidity and helps to solve the liquidity fragmentation problem.

## Warning

This is a very very rough MVP. It is **not** gas-optimized, it is **not** 100% safe, it is **incomplete**.

The tests are **incomplete**.

For the moment, consider this protocol as purely for experimental and pedagogical goals.
