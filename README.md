# Dove Protocol â€¢ ![solidity](https://img.shields.io/badge/solidity-^0.8.15-lightgrey) ![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/whitenois3/dove-protocol?label=license)

Unified liquidity, accessible anywhere.

## What is Dove?

Dove is our take on the decentralized AMM, dAMM, idea that was formulated by Brecht Devos and Louis Guthmann. You can find their original post [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/damm-an-l2-powered-amm/10352).

In short ; liquidity stays on L1, trading happens on L2.

The interface is deployed [here](https://dove.whitenoise.rs/).
